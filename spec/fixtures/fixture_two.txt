Purpose of the GRE 
Subject Tests
The GRE Subject Tests are designed to help graduate 
school admission committees and fellowship sponsors 
assess the qualifications of applicants in specific fields 
of study. The tests also provide you with an assessment 
of your own qualifications.
Scores on the tests are intended to indicate 
knowledge of the subject matter emphasized in many 
undergraduate programs as preparation for graduate 
study. Because past achievement is usually a good 
indicator of future performance, the scores are helpful 
in predicting success in graduate study. Because 
the tests are standardized, the test scores permit 
comparison of students from different institutions with 
different undergraduate programs. For some Subject 
Tests, subscores are provided in addition to the total 
score; these subscores indicate the strengths and 
weaknesses of your preparation, and they may help you 
plan future studies.
The GRE Board recommends that scores on the 
Subject Tests be considered in conjunction with 
other relevant information about applicants. Because 
numerous factors influence success in graduate school, 
reliance on a single measure to predict success is not 
advisable. Other indicators of competence typically 
include undergraduate transcripts showing courses 
taken and grades earned, letters of recommendation, 
and GRE General Test scores. For information about 
the appropriate use of GRE scores, see the GRE Guide 
to the Use of Scores at 
www.ets.org/gre/subject/scores/understand.
Development of the  
Subject Tests
Each new edition of a Subject Test is developed by 
a committee of examiners composed of professors in 
the subject who are on undergraduate and graduate 
faculties in different types of institutions and in 
different regions of the United States and Canada. 
In selecting members for each committee, the GRE 
Program seeks the advice of appropriate professional 
associations in the subject.
The content and scope of each test are specified 
and reviewed periodically by the committee of 
examiners. Test questions are written by committee 
members and by other university faculty members 
who are subject-matter specialists. All questions 
proposed for the test are reviewed and revised by the 
committee and subject-matter specialists at ETS. The 
tests are assembled in accordance with the content 
specifications developed by the committee to ensure 
adequate coverage of the various aspects of the field 
and, at the same time, to prevent overemphasis on 
any single topic. The entire test is then reviewed and 
approved by the committee.

Subject-matter and measurement specialists on the 
ETS staff assist the committee, providing information 
and advice about methods of test construction and 
helping to prepare the questions and assemble the test. 
In addition, each test question is reviewed to eliminate 
language, symbols, or content considered potentially 
offensive, inappropriate for major subgroups of the test-
taking population, or likely to perpetuate any negative 
attitude that may be conveyed to these subgroups. 
Because of the diversity of undergraduate curricula, 
it is not possible for a single test to cover all the 
material you may have studied. The examiners, 
therefore, select questions that test the basic 
knowledge and skills most important for successful 
graduate study in the particular field. The committee 
keeps the test up-to-date by regularly developing new 
editions and revising existing editions. In this way, the 
test content remains current. In addition, curriculum 
surveys are conducted periodically to ensure that the 
content of a test reflects what is currently being taught 
in the undergraduate curriculum.
After a new edition of a Subject Test is first 
administered, examinees? responses to each test 
question are analyzed in a variety of ways to determine 
whether each question functioned as expected. These 
analyses may reveal that a question is ambiguous, 
requires knowledge beyond the scope of the test, or 
is inappropriate for the total group or a particular 
subgroup of examinees taking the test. Such questions 
are not used in computing scores.
Following this analysis, the new test edition is 
equated to an existing test edition. In the equating 
process, statistical methods are used to assess the 
difficulty of the new test. Then scores are adjusted so 
that examinees who took a more difficult edition of 
the test are not penalized, and examinees who took 
an easier edition of the test do not have an advantage. 
Variations in the number of questions in the different 
editions of the test are also taken into account in this 
process.
Scores on the Subject Tests are reported as three-
digit scaled scores with the third digit always zero. 
The maximum possible range for all Subject Test total 
scores is from 200 to 990. The actual range of scores 
for a particular Subject Test, however, may be smaller. 
For Subject Tests that report subscores, the maximum 
possible range is 20 to 99; however, the actual range 
of subscores for any test or test edition may be smaller. 
Subject Test score interpretive information is provided 
in Interpreting Your GRE Scores, which you will receive 
with your GRE score report. This publication is also 
available at www.ets.org/gre/subject/scores/understand.
Content of the Computer 
Science Test
The test consists of approximately 70 multiple-choice 
questions, some of which are grouped in sets and based 
on such materials as diagrams, graphs and program 
fragments. 
 The approximate distribution of questions in each 
edition of the test according to content categories is 
indicated by the following outline. 
 The percentages given are approximate; actual 
percentages will vary slightly from one edition of the 
test to another.

Preparing for a Subject Test
GRE Subject Test questions are designed to measure 
skills and knowledge gained over a long period of 
time. Although you might increase your scores to 
some extent through preparation a few weeks or 
months before you take the test, last minute cramming 
is unlikely to be of further help. The following 
information may be helpful.
?  A general review of your college courses is 
probably the best preparation for the test. 
However, the test covers a broad range of subject 
matter, and no one is expected to be familiar with 
the content of every question. 
?  Use this practice book to become familiar with 
the types of questions in the GRE Computer 
Science Test, taking note of the directions. If you 
understand the directions before you take the 
test, you will have more time during the test to 
focus on the questions themselves.
Test-Taking Strategies
The questions in the practice test in this book 
illustrate the types of multiple-choice questions in the 
test. When you take the actual test, you will mark your 
answers on a separate machine-scorable answer sheet. 
Total testing time is two hours and fifty minutes; there 
are no separately timed sections. Following are some 
general test-taking strategies you may want to consider.
?  Read the test directions carefully, and work as 
rapidly as you can without being careless. For 
each question, choose the best answer from the 
available options.
?  All questions are of equal value; do not waste 
time pondering individual questions you find 
extremely difficult or unfamiliar.
?  You may want to work through the test quite 
rapidly, first answering only the questions about 
which you feel confident, then going back and 
answering questions that require more thought, 
and concluding with the most difficult questions 
if there is time.
?  If you decide to change an answer, make sure 
you completely erase it and fill in the oval 
corresponding to your desired answer.
?  Questions for which you mark no answer or more 
than one answer are not counted in scoring.
?  Your score will be determined by subtracting 
one-fourth the number of incorrect answers from 
the number of correct answers. If you have some 
knowledge of a question and are able to rule out 
one or more of the answer choices as incorrect, 
your chances of selecting the correct answer are 
improved, and answering such questions will 
likely improve your score. It is unlikely that pure 
guessing will raise your score; it may lower your 
score.
?  Record all answers on your answer sheet. 
Answers recorded in your test book will not be 
counted.
?  Do not wait until the last five minutes of a testing 
session to record answers on your answer sheet.

What Your Scores Mean
Your raw score ? that is, the number of questions you 
answered correctly minus one-fourth of the number 
you answered incorrectly ? is converted to the scaled 
score that is reported. This conversion ensures that 
a scaled score reported for any edition of a Subject 
Test is comparable to the same scaled score earned 
on any other edition of the same test. Thus, equal 
scaled scores on a particular Subject Test indicate 
essentially equal levels of performance regardless of 
the test edition taken. Test scores should be compared 
only with other scores on the same Subject Test. (For 
example, a 680 on the Computer Science Test is not 
equivalent to a 680 on the Mathematics Test.)
Before taking the test, you may find it useful 
to know approximately what raw scores would be 
required to obtain a certain scaled score. Several 
factors influence the conversion of your raw score 
to your scaled score, such as the difficulty of the test 
edition and the number of test questions included in 
the computation of your raw score. Based on recent 
editions of the Computer Science Test, the following 
table gives the range of raw scores associated with 
selected scaled scores for three different test editions. 
(Note that when the number of scored questions for a 
given test is greater than the number of actual scaled 
score points, it is likely that two or more raw scores 
will convert to the same scaled score.) The three test 
editions in the table that follows were selected to 
reflect varying degrees of difficulty. Examinees should 
note that future test editions may be somewhat more 
or less difficult than the test editions illustrated in the 
table.

*Raw Score = Number of Correct Answers minus one-fourth the 
number of incorrect answers, rounded to the nearest integer.
For a particular test edition, there are many ways to 
earn the same raw score. For example, on the edition 
listed above as ?Form A,? a raw score of 30 would earn 
a scaled score of 700. Below are a few of the possible 
ways in which a scaled score of 700 could be earned on 
the edition

 13. Unless otherwise stated, concurrent programs execute on a platform in which shared memory is not cached, 
assignment statements execute atomically, and the scheduling algorithm is fair, but no other assumptions are 
made. The following mechanisms are used to control concurrency: 
 
   fork() creates a new child process with memory and register contents initially identical to the  
        parent process. The operation returns 0 in the child process and 1 in the parent process. 
   join() blocks until all child processes have terminated. 
 
  For a semaphore s: 
   the operation P(s) blocks until s > 0 and then decrements s before continuing. 
   the operation V(s) increments s and wakes up one process blocked on s (if any). 
  A binary semaphore is a semaphore restricted to have a value of either 0 or 1, with an initial value of 1. 
  A mutual exclusion lock m, with accompanying lock(m) and unlock(m) operations, is synonymous 
with a binary semaphore. 
 
 14. A loop invariant for a while statement 
     while B do S 
  is an assertion that is true each time the guard B is evaluated during execution of the while statement.

 8. In a grammar: 
 represents a production in the grammar. 
 means  can be derived from  by the application of exactly one production. 
*
 means  can be derived from  by the application of zero or more productions. 
  Unless otherwise specified, 
 (i) symbols appearing on the left-hand side of productions are nonterminal symbols; the remaining  
symbols are terminal symbols; 
 (ii) the leftmost symbol of the first production is the start symbol; and 
 (iii) the start symbol is permitted to appear on the right-hand side of productions. 
 
 9. In a logic diagram: 
  
 10.    represents a D-type flip-flop, which stores the value of its D input when clocked. 
 
 11. Binary tree traversal is defined recursively as follows. 
 Preorder: visit the root, traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree 
 Inorder: traverse the left subtree, visit the root, traverse the right subtree 
 Postorder: traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, visit the root 
 
 12. In a finite automaton diagram, states are represented by circles, with final (or accepting) states indicated by two 
concentric circles. The start state is labeled ?Start?. An arc from state s to state t labeled a indicates a 
transition from s to t on input a. A label a b  indicates that this transition produces an output b. A label 
1 2, , ..., ka a a  indicates that the transition is made on any of the inputs 1 2, , ..., .ka a a  
 
13. For a program segment S and predicates P and Q, to say that the triple {P}S{Q} is partially correct means that 
if P is true before initiation of S, then Q is true upon termination of S. To say that {P}S{Q} is totally correct 
means that it is partially correct and S terminates for all inputs for which P is true. 
Given that {P}S{Q} is partially correct, a precondition is any assertion that implies P, and a postcondition is 
any assertion that is implied by Q. 
 
 14. A loop invariant for a while statement 
     while B do S 
  is an assertion that is true each time the guard B is evaluated during execution of the while statement.

are ?Yes,? ?Maybe,? and ?No.? The researcher wants to know how many people answer with any given 
combination of responses. A programmer is designing a data structure to collate the responses to this 
questionnaire. The programmer decides to use a base structure containing 6 memory locations, one for  
each question. Each element will contain a 2 for ?Yes,? a 1 for ?Maybe,? and a 0 for ?No.? One person?s 
response may look like this: 
 
1 2 2 1 0 1

57. A hiker faces the 0/1 Knapsack problem. There are 7 items to be packed into the knapsack, each with value iv  
and weight iw  as shown in the following table. 
 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
iv  3 6 8 1 2 5 7
iw  7 3 5 1 4 2 6
 
  The knapsack, which is initially empty, can hold a maximum weight of 24, so some item(s) must be left behind, 
and fractions of items cannot be packed. The optimality criterion is to maximize the total value of the items that 
are placed in the knapsack. The hiker fills the knapsack one item at a time, using a heuristic algorithm that is 
greedy on value density, where the value density of an item is its value/weight ratio. When this heuristic 
algorithm is used, what is the total value of the items that are packed, and is this total optimal? 
 Total Value Optimal/Not Optimal 
(A) 29 Optimal 
(B) 29 Not optimal 
(C) 30 Optimal

60. Suppose that stacks and queues are provided as opaque data types, offering only operations to add elements, to 
remove elements, and to test for emptiness. Suppose that a programmer wants to count the number of elements 
in a given stack or queue C, which is currently in some state t, using only one auxiliary stack or queue D.

66. Query optimizers typically use summaries of data distributions to estimate the sizes of the intermediate tables 
generated during query processing. One popular such summarization scheme is a histogram, whereby the input 
range is partitioned into buckets and a cumulative count is maintained of the number of tuples falling in each 
bucket. The distribution within a bucket is assumed to be uniform for the purposes of estimation. 
  The following shows one such histogram for a relation R on a discrete attribute a with domain [1..10]. 
   ? Bucket 1:  Range = [1..2], Cumulative tuple count = 6 
   ? Bucket 2:  Range = [3..8], Cumulative tuple count = 30

b. The Subject Tests are intended to measure your achievement in a specialized field of study. Most of the questions are 
concerned with subject matter that is probably familiar to you, but some of the questions may refer to areas that you 
have not studied.
Your score will be determined by subtracting one-fourth the number of incorrect answers from the number of correct 
answers. Questions for which you mark no answer or more than one answer are not counted in scoring. If you have 
some knowledge of a question and are able to rule out one or more of the answer choices as incorrect, your chances of 
selecting the correct answer are improved, and answering such questions will likely improve your score. It is unlikely 
that pure guessing will raise your score; it may lower your score.
You are advised to use your time effectively and to work as rapidly as you can without losing accuracy. Do not spend 
too much time on questions that are too difficult for you. Go on to the other questions and come back to the difficult 
ones later if you can.
YOU MUST INDICATE ALL YOUR ANSWERS ON THE SEPARATE ANSWER SHEET. No credit will be given 
for anything written in this examination book, but you may write in the book as much as you wish to work out your 
answers. After you have decided on your response to a question, fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet. 
bE SURE THAT EACH MARK IS DARK AND COMPLETELY FILLS THE OVAL. Mark only one answer to each 
question. No credit will be given for multiple answers. Erase all stray marks. If you change an answer, be sure that all 
previous marks are erased completely. Incomplete erasures may be read as intended answers. Do not be concerned that 
the answer sheet provides spaces for more answers than there are questions in the test.
Copy the Test Name and Form Code in box 7 on your answer

COMPUTER SCIENCE TEST  
PRACTICE BOOK
Scoring Your Subject Test
The Computer Science Test scores are reported on a 
200 to 990 score scale in ten-point increments. The 
actual range of scores is smaller, and it varies from 
edition to edition because different editions are not of 
precisely the same difficulty. However, this variation 
in score range is usually small and should be taken into 
account mainly when comparing two very high scores. 
In general, differences between scores at the 99th 
percentile should be ignored. The score conversion 
table on page 53 shows the score range for this edition 
of the test only.
The worksheet on page 52 lists the correct answers 
to the questions. Columns are provided for you to 
mark whether you chose the correct (C) answer or 
an incorrect (I) answer to each question. Draw a line 
across any question you omitted, because it is not 
counted in the scoring. At the bottom of the page, 
enter the total number correct and the total number 
incorrect. Divide the total incorrect by 4 and subtract 
the resulting number from the total correct. Then 
round the result to the nearest whole number. This 
will give you your raw total score. Use the total score 
conversion table to find the scaled total score that 
corresponds to your raw total score. 
Example: Suppose you chose the correct answers 
to 38 questions and incorrect answers to 22. Dividing 
22 by 4 yields 5.5. Subtracting 5.5 from 38 equals 
32.5, which is rounded to 33. The raw score of 33 
corresponds to a scaled score of 740.

COMPUTER SCIENCE TEST  
PRACTICE BOOK
Evaluating Your Performance
Now that you have scored your test, you may wish to 
compare your performance with the performance of 
others who took this test. Both the worksheet on page 
52 and the table on page 53 use performance data from 
GRE Computer Science Test examinees.
 The data in the worksheet on page 52 are based on 
the performance of a sample of examinees selected to 
represent all GRE Computer Science Test examinees 
tested between July 2007 and June 2010. The numbers 
in the column labeled ?P+? on the worksheet indi-
cate the percentages of examinees in this sample who 
answered each question correctly. You may use these 
numbers as a guide for evaluating your performance on 
each test question.
 The table on page 53 contains, for each scaled 
score, the percentage of examinees tested between 
July 2007 and June 2010 who received lower scores. 
Interpretive data based on the scores earned by exam-
inees tested in this three-year period will be used by 
admissions officers in the 2011-12 testing year. These 
percentages appear in the score conversion table in a 
column to the right of the scaled scores. For example, 
in the percentage column opposite the scaled score 
of 730 is the number 56. This means that 56 percent 
of the GRE Computer Science Test examinees tested 
between July 2007 and June 2010 scored lower than 
730. To compare yourself with this population, look at 
the percentage next to the scaled score you earned on 
the practice test.
 It is important to realize that the conditions under 
which you tested yourself were not exactly the same as 
those you will encounter at a test center. It is impossi-
ble to predict how different test-taking conditions will 
affect test performance, and this is only one factor that 
may account for differences between your practice test 
scores and your actual test scores. By comparing your 
performance on this practice test with the performance 
of other GRE Computer Science Test examinees, how-
ever, you will be able to determine your strengths and 
weaknesses and can then plan a program of study to 
prepare yourself for taking the GRE Computer Science 
Test under standard conditions.
